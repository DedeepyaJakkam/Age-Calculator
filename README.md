# Age-Calculator


An Age Calculator built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS allows users to input their date of birth and instantly calculate their age in years, months, and days. This is a beginner-friendly project to practice working with date manipulations in JavaScript, form handling in HTML, and styling with CSS. Below is a description of each component:

1. HTML: Structure
The HTML provides the skeleton of the web page. It includes:

A heading and instructions for the user.
An input field to select the date of birth using the <input type="date"> element.
A button to trigger the age calculation.
A section or paragraph to display the calculated age.
2. CSS: Styling
CSS enhances the visual appeal of the age calculator.

The layout can be made responsive and visually appealing with modern design elements.
Style buttons, inputs, and results for clarity and user-friendliness.
Add hover effects for interactivity and color schemes for aesthetics.
3. JavaScript: Functionality
JavaScript handles the logic for calculating the age:

Fetch the user-selected date from the input field.
Use the Date object to compare the current date with the selected date.
Calculate the difference in years, months, and days.
Display the result dynamically without refreshing the page.
